    <p align="center">Cake is a form of sweet food made from flour, sugar, and other ingredients, that is usually baked.
        <Br>In their oldest forms, cakes were modifications of bread, but cakes now cover a wide range of preparations that can be simple or elaborate, and that share features with other desserts such as pastries, meringues, custards, and pies.
        <br> The most commonly used cake ingredients include flour, sugar, eggs, butter or oil or margarine, a liquid, and a leavening agent, such as baking soda or baking powder.
        <br> Common additional ingredients and flavourings include dried, candied, or fresh fruit, nuts, cocoa, and extracts such as vanilla, with numerous substitutions for the primary ingredients.
        <br> Cakes can also be filled with fruit preserves, nuts or dessert sauces (like pastry cream), iced with buttercream or other icings, and decorated with marzipan, piped borders, or candied fruit.<br> Cake is often served as a celebratory dish
        on ceremonial occasions, such as weddings, anniversaries, and birthdays.
        <br>There are countless cake recipes; some are bread-like, some are rich and elaborate, and many are centuries old.
        <i> Cake making is no longer a complicated procedure;</i> while at one time considerable labor went into cake making
        <b>particularly the whisking of egg foams</b>, baking equipment and directions have been simplified so that even the most amateur of cooks may bake a cake. </p>
