                <p>Cake is a form of sweet food made from flour, sugar, and other ingredients, that is usually baked.
                    <Br>In their oldest forms, cakes were modifications of bread, but cakes now cover a wide range of preparations that can be simple or elaborate, and that share features with other desserts such as pastries, meringues, custards, and pies.
                    <br>The most commonly used cake ingredients include flour, sugar, eggs, butter or oil or margarine, a liquid, and a leavening agent, such as baking soda or baking powder. <br>Common additional ingredients and flavourings include dried,
                    candied, or fresh fruit, nuts, cocoa, and extracts such as vanilla, with numerous substitutions for the primary ingredients. <br>Cakes can also be filled with fruit preserves, nuts or dessert sauces (like pastry cream), iced with buttercream
                    or other icings, and decorated with marzipan, piped borders, or candied fruit.<br>Cake is often served as a celebratory dish on ceremonial occasions, such as weddings, anniversaries, and birthdays. <br>There are countless cake recipes;
                    some are bread-like, some are rich and elaborate, and many are centuries old. <i>Cake making is no longer a complicated procedure;
    </i>while at one time considerable labor went into cake making <b>particularly the whisking of egg foams</b>, baking equipment and directions have been simplified so that even the most amateur of cooks may bake a cake. </p>
